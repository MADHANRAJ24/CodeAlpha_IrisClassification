# CodeAlpha_IrisClassification
📘 Project Title: Iris Flower Classification
📌 Internship: Data Science — CodeAlpha
📖 Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Science internship at CodeAlpha.
The task focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The model uses measurements of sepal and petal (length and width) as input features to predict the species.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📊 Steps Involved

Data Preprocessing

Loaded the Iris dataset

Checked for missing values

Standardized the features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized data distributions

Pair plots of features

Correlation analysis

Model Training

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Model Evaluation

Accuracy score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

🚀 Results

Achieved 95–100% accuracy on test data.

Logistic Regression and Decision Tree performed best.
